# Terms-and-Conditions-Summarizer

<p align = "justify"> While making a new account on a website or while filling a job application or while registering for some newsletter or making an account on Social networking sites, etc. we often come across a large document containing the terms and conditions pertaining that organization. The document having terms and conditions is so lengthy and complex that we often accept it even without reading. Many times, these terms and conditions contain details about sharing our personal data to third parties, which we entrusted over to one organization. </p>
